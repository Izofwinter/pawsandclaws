Our dog is very picky about people and so far the Paws & Claws employees have all been <br>wonderful. Super understanding of our dogs peculiar ways and have been patient with introducing <br>themselves to her. They have been to our home several times and we couldn't be happier. So glad <br>I found Paws & Claws!</p>

I have used Paws & Claws for almost 3 months and they have been my saving grace.<br> I absolutely love them. If you are in a situation where you need reliable people to <br>take care of you pet, They are definitely the one. Give them a Try I promise they wonâ€™t disappoint.</p>
