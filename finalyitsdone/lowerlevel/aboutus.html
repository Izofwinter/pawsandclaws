<h3>PSI member pet sitters are affiliated with the most widely respected association in the industry—an association established by Patti J. Moran. Patti wrote the first book on the topic—Pet Sitting for Profit—and is considered the pioneer of the pet-sitting industry.

    Disillusioned by the corporate world and inspired by a good friend who was a huge animal lover like herself, Patti Moran started her own pet-sitting business in North Carolina in 1983. 
    
    Caring for other peoples’ pets just like they were her own wasn’t just a business idea for Patti—it was a passion. 
    
    She found several resources about starting a small business, but there were no resources on pet sitting or in-home pet care. She seriously contemplated the risks of launching an "unheard of" business. The uncertainty of venturing into an unestablished industry was frightening. And, as she searched for business insurance coverage, many doors were shut in her face. No one had heard of—or understood—professional pet sitting. 
    
    After word of her business spread to other parts of the United States, Patti was prompted to put her how-to advice on paper. In 1987 she wrote the first book and premier reference on the topic—Pet Sitting for Profit. </h3>
<h3>In 1989, she unified pet sitters for the first time through a non-profit association, and in 1992, she partnered with Business Insurers of the Carolinas to offer pet sitters the first ever business insurance for professional pet sitters. 

    In 1994, after 10 years of giving care to thousands of felines, canines, fish and fowl, she set out to help other pet lovers turn their passion for pets into profit and founded Pet Sitters International (PSI).
    
    Throughout her career, Patti has received many awards and accolades recognizing her contributions to the pet-sitting industry, including being named the 2013 Pet Industry Woman of the Year (Corporate) and a 2015 Pet Age ICON award recipient.</h3>
<h3>Pet Sitters International is the most highly recognized advocate for and the most respected authority on pet sitting throughout the world.  This is made possible through our dedicated employees, our superior educational resources and our passion and respect for the pet-sitting profession.
